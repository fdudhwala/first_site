<h3>Research</h3>
<p> 
	The working title of Farzana's thesis is: "The Relationship Between Self-Quantifying Technologies and the Self: The "Construction" of Self-Improvement".
	Using Science and Technology Studies to frame the phenomenon, Farzana is doing a multi-sited ethnographic study of the relationship between 'self-quantifying' technologies and the self, and the 'construction' of self-improvement. In particular, she is focussing on understanding the use of these technologies in the cases of the Quantified Self and amateur triathletes. She also aims to understand the technologies from the perspective of the inventors and designers and for this she will spend some time with QS technology companies and start-ups in the Bay area.
