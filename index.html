<h3>Research</h3>
<p> 
	Her research focuses on technologies that allow people to track and quantify certain aspects of their bodies, selves and environments. The number of people using self-quantifying technologies to manage their wellbeing is rapidly growing and manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the demand. Consequently, Farzana is exploring the implications of using self-quantifying technologies, building on STS as a theoretical basis.

	The working title of Farzana’s thesis is: ‘The implication of self-quantifying technologies on self-improvement’. She is interested in understanding the extent to which self-quantifying technologies and the surrounding discourse change perceptions of what it means to be healthy and do well. 

	Her methodology is qualitative and she is doing ethnographic fieldwork where people use self-quantifying technologies. As part of her early research she is immersing herself in existing technologies.  Next year her work will move into more formal fieldwork and interviews.
